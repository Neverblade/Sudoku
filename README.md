# Sudoku
A Sudoku solver and puzzle generator.

Note: the puzzle generator is NOT finished, it only generates the completed puzzle.

To use the solver, input your puzzle in the input.txt file (Follow the format example) and run SudokuSolver.
To use the generator, run SudokuGenerator.
Both programs will generate an output txt file and print using that.

Features:

     Sudoku solving using the Depth-First Search algorithm.
     Sudoku generation to create completed Sudoku puzzles.
     
     
What I Learned:

     Using pre-calculated values to deal with awkward constraints (unique #s in a grid)
     Applying Depth-First Search to both solving and generating.
     
     
Needs Work:

     Sudoku generation not finished, need to learn how to remove numbers while keeping the puzzle solvable.
